This is the frontend of my final SOOP project

## Getting Started

First you should add and configure the .env.local with:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
JWT_SECRET=aulas_pwr

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
